# Using The Examples

Iced is a fast-moving GUI with an architecture that is changing and being updated frequently.

When looking at the examples, it is important to ensure you are using the same iced version as the examples. The examples on GitHub follow the latest changes to Iced.

To follow along with the examples, you can add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
iced = { git = "https://github.com/iced-rs/iced", branch = "master", features = ["tokio"] }
```


For a good starting point, check out the [Counter Example](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/tree/master/examples/counter), which is the example contained in this book. Remember to use the "master" branch if you are looking at an example in the "master" branch.

You can also explore the branches for [previous versions](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/branches) on Github for older versions and examples.
